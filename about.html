						<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
							<p>As a student organization at the University of Notre Dame, the Asian American Association of Notre Dame strives to foster Asian awareness throughout the local faculty and student body as well as the entire nation. AAA proudly celebrates Asian American heritage in a variety of different forums and endeavors to achieve a unified level of awareness regarding Asian American issues. Through good fellowship, service, and events that showcase the unique values of various ethnic cultures, we hope to positively reflect the essence of being Asian American.</p>

							<h3>Origins of AAA</h3>
							<p>In the fall of 1992, four students looked into ways to improve lives of Asian American students at the University of Notre Dame. Students Erica Deiparine '94, Natasha Filipski, Henry Mark '92, Jeannie Wong '94 and advisor Priscilla Wong initiated the forming of the club now known as Asian American Association of Notre Dame. According to the club's constitution, the purpose of AAA is to better promote an appreciation of Asian and Asian American cultures and to provide a comfortable setting for social interaction of Asian American students at ND.</p>
							<h3>Club Membership</h3>
							<p>Become an official AAA member by paying club dues to the current club treasurer. <b>$10.00</b> goes a long way considering all the services AAA provides throughout the year. You must be a dues-paying member in order to participate in certain activities (e.g. conferences or other out-of-town trips), receive other benefits (e.g. free or discounted admissions to AAA-associated events), and have the privilege of voting in the spring elections.</p>
							<p>As far as the Student Activities Office is concerned, a club is only as large as the number of people who have paid dues. The CCC then uses this official membership figure in determining the club's financial allocation for the following year.</p>

						<h3>Did You Know...</h3>
							<p>There was tight competition in 1996 when it came to deciding on a name for the first ever AAA fashion show. Besides Asian Allure, other potential names that received a large percentage of votes were An Asian Fantasy, FantAsia, Asian Spices, and One Night in Asia.</p>
							<p>lt used to be an Asian Allure tradition that each year the MCs would write and perform a comedic song.</p>
							<p>AAA brought Elaine Chao to speak on campus at it's annual student/faculty luncheon in April 1999. Her resume included being former Deputy Secretary of Transportation, former director of the Peace Corps, and former CEO of The United Way. Little did AAA know at the time that Elaine Chao would be appointed Secretary of Labor in 2001, the first Asian American woman to hold a cabinet position as well as the first Chinese American.</p>
							<p>AAA won Club of the Year in 2005-2006, 2009-2010, and 2013-2014, Club Advisor of the Year (Priscilla Wong) in 1999-2000 and 2009-2010, Club Officer of the Year (Kristine Yuen) in 2009-2010, Club Program of the Year in 2001-2002 (for the In-Focus Asian Conference co-sponsored with FASO, KSA, and VSA) and 2009-2010 (for Mastering the Art of Networking) from Notre Dame's Club Coordination Council.</p>
